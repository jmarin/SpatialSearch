SpatialSearch
=============

SpatialSearch is a RESTful API that allows the user to query geographic entities by latitude and longitude, and extract data. 


What Problem This Solves
------------------------

Implementing spatial data analysis and queries can often be combersome and difficult for end users.  This provides a simple way to search any spatial data with a latitude / longitude (e.g. GPS point from a smartphone).  


How This Solves It
------------------
With this simple search, any spatial data can return the attributes at any given location.  This is a RESTful API with simple approaches for the query and response; there is no complicated middle-ware for this implementation.


Building
--------

SpatialSearch is built with [Maven] `http://maven.apache.org/`. The build produces a WAR file suitable for deployment on any JEE 5 compliant Web Container (i.e. Jetty, Tomcat, etc.). 

To perform a full build, including integration tests (see dependencies below before doing this):

`mvn clean install`

To run the unit tests (in-memory):

`mvn test`


Dependencies
------------

* [PostGIS] `http://postgis.refractions.net/`, the spatial extension to PostgreSQL, is necessary to run the API in production. The Unit tests included with this project use the H2 [GeoDB] `https://github.com/jdeolive/geodb` in-memory database, allowing for rapid development without the need for a database server. 

* Data. The API exposes the State, County and Census Block geographic layers from the 2010 Census Bureau. These can be obtained from the [TIGER] `http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2010/tgrshp2010.html` download page and need to be imported into PostGIS in order to be able to publish the API. SpatialSearch uses the default schema of the tables, grouped into a `census` schema within a database called `gisdb` by default. All these parameters can be changed

* SpatialSearch uses [Hibernate Spatial] `http://www.hibernatespatial.org/` for the geospatial functionality. This library supports the same type of functionality on other Spatial DBMS systems such as Oracle Spatial, Microsoft SQL Server, etc. For more information please visit [its website](http://www.hibernatespatial.org/).

Usage
-----

This first version of the API exposes a "point in polygon" functionality, as follows (example running locally from embedded Jetty Servlet Container)

`http://localhost:8081/spatialsearch/census/<geography>?latitude=<latitude>&longitude=<longitude>&format=<format>` _

where

``<geography>`` is the type of layer being queried. Currently it can take the following values: state2010, county2010, block2010

``<longitude>`` is the Longitude of the position to query on. Expresses in decimal degrees, WGS84 projection is assumed (EPSG code 4326)

``<latitude>`` is the Latitude of the position to query on. Expresses in decimal degrees, WGS84 projection is assumed (EPSG code 4326)

``<format>`` is the output format. Currently it can take the following values: xml, json and jsonp. This parameter is optional, if not specified the response will be enconded as XML
